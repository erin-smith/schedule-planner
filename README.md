# schedule-planner

This clever schedule-planner displays a daily 8AM-5pm calendar and lets the user plan appointments for each hour of the day. These are stored in local storage and cleared using the buttons. You can generate a new quote from a famous author or figure as daily inspiration, or as many times as you wish.

The project utilizes Moment.js, Quotes API, jQuery, AJAX/JSON, Bootstrap and it dynamically updates the html/css via jQuery. 

The calendar displays the current time, there are color-changing timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. White is present, Green is future and Blue is past. You can enter an event, meeting, or reminder in each table row and save it in the browser and to local storage. The event remains on the page when you refresh- and in local storage.  If you wish to cancel an event, you can click the cancel button and clear the event from the text area and from local storage.
