# schedule-planner

This simple schedule-planner utilizes bootstrap, html, css, jQuery, AJAX, API, moment.js and dynamically updated html/css via jQuery.  It allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. And generate a new quote of the day from a famous author or public figure. 

The calendar displays the current time, there are timeblocks for standards business hours. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. You can enter an event, meeting, or reminder in each table row and save it on the browser and to local storage. The event should remain on the page when you refresh.

This app is not quite finished and the code doesn't fully work.
